# UNIT-4-GAME

The game starts with a random number. The player has four crystals to choose from. When a crystal is clicked
a specfic amount of points is added to the total score. The game is won by matching the total score to the
random number, the game is lost if the total score goes over the random number. The value of each crystal  is 
hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the game will change the random number and
the crystal's values.
